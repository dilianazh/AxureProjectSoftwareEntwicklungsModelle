# AxureProjectSoftwareEntwicklungsModelle
A project created for the Interactive Systems course at the Otto-von-Guericke-Universit√§t Magdeburg. 
The project was created with the goal of developing a website that enables Computer Science students to learn about Software Development, 
as that is a a very important part of their studies and future careers. 
The tool used for the development of the prototype was Axure RP 
and it was designed in accordance with the requirements an interactive system must fulfill. 

Since it was a group project, it was created by me and my colleague - Maria Rangelova.
